## Hazards

### As GM Moves

Write one or more GM moves that reflect each of the following, as makes sense for the hazard:

* How its presence is revealed or foreshadowed
* How it hurts, hinders, or harms
* How it escalates or gets worse
* How it thwarts attempts to overcome it

If dynamic, changing: give it an instinct, written as an intended action (e.g. "to bury everything").

### As a countdown

1. Start with the final, ultimate bad thing that can happen (the tunnel collapses, they roll Last Breath, etc.). Write it as a GM move.
2. Write 1-4 additional GM moves that describe how it starts, and how it escalates.
3. Optionally: write triggers that cause it to escalate; can be fictional ("Each time the pillars are damaged") or mechanical ("Each time someone rolls doubles").

### As player moves

1. Write a fictional trigger, addressed to the characters. "When you \<trigger the hazard\>...."
2. Write the procedure that follows, using whatever combination of the following makes sense:

      * happens (and is bad)
      * Pick X from a list
      * Tell us
      * Lose
      * Take damage/suffer a debility/Last Breath
      * Roll +STAT (or something); on a 10+, on a 7-9, (optionally) on a 6-,.
