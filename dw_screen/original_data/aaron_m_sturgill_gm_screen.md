# Dungeon World GM Reference

## Broad Strokes

### Agenda

* Portray a fantastic world
* Fill the characters' lives with adventure
* Play to find out what happens

### Principles

* Draw maps, leave blanks
* Address the characters, not the players
* Embrace the fantastic
* Make a move that follows
* Never speak the name of your move
* Give every monster life
* Name every person
* Ask questions and use the answers
* Be a fan of the characters
* Think dangerous
* Begin and end with the fiction
* Think offscreen, too

## GM Moves

* Use a monster, danger, or location move
* Reveal an unwelcome truth
* Show signs of an approaching threat
* Deal damage
* Use up their resources
* Turn their move back on them
* Separate them
* Give an opportunity that fits a class' abilities
* Show a downside to their class, race, or equipment
* Offer an opportunity, with or without cost
* Put someone in a spot
* Tell them the requirements or consequences and ask

### When to Make a Move

* When everyone looks to you to find out what happens
* When the players give you a golden opportunity
* When they roll a 6-

> **Note on Moves:** Hard moves have immediate consequences; soft moves do not. Dealing damage is almost always a hard move.

### Choosing a Move

* Start by looking at the obvious consequences of the action that triggered it.
* If you already have an idea, think on it for a second to make sure it fits your agenda and principles and then do it.
* Let your moves snowball. Build on the success or failure of the characters' moves and on your own previous moves.

### Dungeon Moves

These are particularly well-suited for when the characters enter a new room or hallway and want to know what they find there.

* Change the environment
* Point to a looming threat
* Introduce a new faction or type of creature
* Use a threat from an existing faction or type of creature
* Make them backtrack
* Present riches at a price
* Present a challenge to one of the characters

## Basic Moves

### **Hack and Slash**

When you attack an enemy in melee, **roll+STR**.

* **On a 10+:** You deal your damage to the enemy and avoid their attack. At your option, you may choose to do **+1d6 damage** but expose yourself to the enemy's attack.
* **On a 7-9:** You deal your damage to the enemy and the enemy makes an attack against you.

### **Volley**

When you take aim and shoot at an enemy at range, **roll+DEX**.

* **On a 10+:** You have a clear shot, deal your damage.
* **On a 7-9:** Choose one (whichever you choose you deal your damage):
  * You have to move to get the shot placing you in danger as described by the GM.
  * You have to take what you can get: **-1d6 damage**.
  * You have to take several shots, reducing your ammo by one.

### **Defy Danger**

When you act despite an imminent threat or suffer a calamity, say how you deal with it and **roll**.
If you do it...

* ...by powering through, **+STR**
* ...by getting out of the way or acting fast, **+DEX**
* ...by enduring, **+CON**
* ...with quick thinking, **+INT**
* ...through mental fortitude, **+WIS**
* ...using charm and social grace, **+CHA**
* **On a 10+:** You do what you set out to, the threat doesn't come to bear.
* **On a 7-9:** You stumble, hesitate, or flinch: the GM will offer you a worse outcome, hard bargain, or ugly choice.

### **Discern Realities**

When you closely study a situation or person, **roll+WIS**.

* **On a 10+:** Ask the GM 3 questions from the list below.
* **On a 7-9:** Ask 1.
* **Either way:** Take **+1 forward** when acting on the answers.

**Questions:**

* What happened here recently?
* What is about to happen?
* What should I be on the lookout for?
* What here is useful or valuable to me?
* Who's really in control here?
* What here is not what it appears to be?

### **Spout Lore**

When you consult your accumulated knowledge about something, **roll+INT**.

* **On a 10+:** The GM will tell you something interesting and useful about the subject relevant to your situation.
* **On a 7-9:** The GM will only tell you something interesting—it's on you to make it useful. The GM might ask you "How do you know this?" Tell them the truth, now.

### **Defend**

When you stand in defense of a person, item, or location under attack, **roll+CON**.

* **On a 10+:** **Hold 3**.
* **On a 7-9:** **Hold 1**.

* **As long as you stand in defense:** When you or the thing you defend is attacked you may spend **hold, 1 for 1**, to choose an option:

  * Redirect an attack from the thing you defend to yourself
  * Halve the attack's effect or damage
  * Open up the attacker to an ally giving that ally **+1 forward** against the attacker
  * Deal damage to the attacker equal to your level

### **Parley**

When you have leverage on a GM Character and manipulate them, **roll+CHA**. Leverage is something they need or want.

* **On a 10+:** They do what you ask if you first promise what they ask of you.
* **On a 7-9:** They will do what you ask, but need some concrete assurance of your promise, right now.

### **Aid or Interfere**

When you help or hinder someone, **roll+bond** with them.

* **On a 10+:** They take **+1 or -2** to their roll, your choice.
* **On a 7-9:** They still get a modifier, but you also expose yourself to danger, retribution, or cost.
