# Broad Strokes

## Agenda

* Portray a fantastic world
* Fill the characters' lives with adventure
* Play to find out what happens

## Principles

* Draw maps, leave blanks
* Address the characters, not the players
* Embrace the fantastic
* Make a move that follows
* Never speak the name of your move
* Give every monster life
* Name every person
* Ask questions and use the answers
* Be a fan of the characters
* Think dangerous
* Begin and end with the fiction
* Think offscreen, too
