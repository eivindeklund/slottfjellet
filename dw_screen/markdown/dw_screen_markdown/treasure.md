# Treasure (Loot)

Start with the monster's damage die, modified if the monster is:

* **Hoarder:** roll damage die twice, take higher result.
* **Far from home:** add at least one ration (usable by anyone with similar taste).
* **Magical:** some strange item, possibly magical.
* **Divine:** a sign of a deity (or deities).
* **Planar:** something not of this earth.
* **Lord over others:** **+1d4** to the roll.
* **Ancient and noteworthy:** **+1d4** to the roll.

Roll the monster's damage die plus any added dice to find the monster's treasure:
